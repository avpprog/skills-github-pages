colours = pd.Series(["Red", "Green", "Blue"])
-> S in series is capital
-> Contents are written in ([...])

df = pd.DataFrame({"Colours":colours, "Brand":car_type})
-> format within parenthesis is:  { "column_name" : series, "column2_name" : series }

car_sales_df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/refs/heads/master/data/car-sales.csv', index_col=0)
-> use raw format in csv file while importing from github

car_sales_df.dtypes
-> to find datatype of single column: dataframe.column.dtype
-> for all cols: dataframe.dtypes

len(car_sales_df)
-> finding length / row_count of dataframe
